# HelloWorld

A simple hello world program to demonstrate how to run a
program on the Hexagon DSP.

The following environment varaiables need to be set:

```
HEXAGON_SDK_ROOT
HEXAGON_TOOLS_ROOT
```
If the SDK is installed as $HOME/Qualcomm/Hexagon_SDK/2.0/...
```
HEXAGON_SDK_ROOT=$HOME/Qualcomm/Hexagon_SDK/2.0
```

The Hexagon SDK 2.0 comes with the Hexagon Tools 6.4.06. There is
a newer toolchain available (7.2.10). Set your HEXAGON_TOOLS_ROOT
environment to the newer tools version:
```
HEXAGON_TOOLS_ROOT=$HOME/Qualcomm/HEXAGON_Tools/7.2.10/Tools
```
