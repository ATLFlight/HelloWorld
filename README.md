# HelloWorld

A simple hello world program to demonstrate how to run a
program on the Hexagon&trade; DSP.

The Hexagon SDK 2.0 and following environment varaiables need to be set:

```
HEXAGON_SDK_ROOT
HEXAGON_TOOLS_ROOT
```
If the SDK is installed as /opt/Qualcomm/Hexagon_SDK/2.0/...
```
HEXAGON_SDK_ROOT=/opt/Qualcomm/Hexagon_SDK/2.0
```

The Hexagon SDK 2.0 comes with the Hexagon Tools 6.4.06. There is
also a newer toolchain available (7.2.10). Set you HEXAGON_TOOLS_ROOT
environment variable appropriately:
```
HEXAGON_TOOLS_ROOT=/opt/Qualcomm/HEXAGON_Tools/6.4.06
or
HEXAGON_TOOLS_ROOT=/opt/Qualcomm/HEXAGON_Tools/7.2.10
```
